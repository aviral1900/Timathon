If you want to run this project locally:
> Create a folder named ubuntu in your home directory like this.

>   `~/ubuntu/` and clone this project at this location

> Path should look like `~/ubuntu/Timathon` and change all paths inside app.py and AI/image_captioning/sample.py accordingly.

> Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt along with (//pytorch command_to be filled//)
